# Create Index in redis:-> Before creating the index let's describe the dataset and insert entries.

# Sample Dataset: movies

A movie is represented by the following attributes:

movie_id 			: The unique ID of the movie, internal to this database
title 				: The title of the movie.
plot 				: A summary of the movie.
genre 				: The genre of the movie, for now a movie will only have a single genre.
release_year 		: The year the movie was released as a <numerical value>.
rating 				: A <numeric value> representing the public's rating for this movie.
votes 				: Number of votes.
poster 				: Link to the movie poster.
imdb_id 			: id of the movie in the IMDB database.


# Key and Data structure:
-> first things to look when building your application is to define the structure of the key and data (data design/data modeling).
-> For example in this application where the database will probably deal with various business objects: 
	movies, actors, theaters, users, 
	so we can use the following pattern:

		business_object:key

HSET movie:11002 title "Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back" plot "After the Rebels are brutally overpowered by the Empire on the ice planet Hoth, Luke Skywalker begins Jedi training with Yoda, while his friends are pursued by Darth Vader and a bounty hunter named Boba Fett all over the galaxy." release_year 1980 genre "Action" rating 8.7 votes 1127635 imdb_id tt0080684
HSET movie:11003 title "The Godfather" plot "The aging patriarch of an organized crime dynasty transfers control of his clandestine empire to his reluctant son." release_year 1972 genre "Drama" rating 9.2 votes 1563839 imdb_id tt0068646

HMGET movie:11002 title rating

output:
1) "Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"
2) "8.7"


-> increment the rating of this movie using:
HINCRBYFLOAT movie:11002 rating 0.1

output:
"8.8"


# Search & Indexing:
-> simple and automatic way to create secondary indices on Redis Hashes. (more datastructure will eventually come)
-> Do not index all fields
	Indexes take space in memory, and must be updated when the primary data is updated. 
	So create the index carefully and keep the definition up to date with your needs.
