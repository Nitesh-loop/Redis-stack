# Basic Redis Commands:
1. Storing a Key-Value Pair
SET name "Nitesh"

2. Retrieving a Value
GET name

3. Checking if a Key Exists
EXISTS name

1   # (1 means key exists, 0 means it doesn't)


5. Incrementing & Decrementing Values
SET count 10
INCR count   # Increments count by 1 (output: 11)
DECR count   # Decrements count by 1 (output: 10)

6. Working with Lists
LPUSH fruits "Apple" "Banana" "Cherry"   # Adds elements to the left
RPUSH fruits "Mango"                     # Adds element to the right
LRANGE fruits 0 -1                        # Fetches all elements
LPOP fruits                               # Removes first element
RPOP fruits                               # Removes last element

7. Working with Sets
SADD colors "Red" "Green" "Blue"
SMEMBERS colors   # Shows all elements
SISMEMBER colors "Red"  # Checks if "Red" is in the set (returns 1 if yes, 0 if no)
SREM colors "Green"  # Removes "Green"


8. Working with Hashes (Key-Value Dictionary)---> user ?
HSET user name "John" age 30 city "Delhi"
HGET user name        # Retrieves "John"
HGETALL user         # Retrieves all fields and values
HDEL user city       # Deletes "city" field



9. Working with Expiry (TTL)
SET session "active"
EXPIRE session 10   # Expires in 10 seconds
TTL session        # Checks remaining time
